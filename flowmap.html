        <p class="card-text"> This flow map displays internal migration patterns in Indonesia over the span of five years. The data was published in 2010 and includes 34 provinces in Indonesia. This is in contrast to the 38 provinces that Indonesia has today because one of the provinces broke into five parts in 2022. Mapping origin-destination flows in Indonesia is a unique task because the country contains over 18,000 islands, most of which are very small. Additionally, some of the provinces within these islands are small district-like provinces that contain a single city like the Special Region of Yogyakarta and the Special Region of Jakarta. This combination of geographic and administrative boundary challenges means that it is almost impossible to show a relevant number of migration flows for the country while ensuring that choropleth information in smaller provinces is still visible. To resolve this issue, I have created two flow maps, one smaller-scale map that shows the entire countryâ€™s top 100 flows, and one larger-scale map that shows the top 50 flows in the southwestern portion of the country where migration flows are the densest. The provinces of Yogyakarta and Jakarta are also in southwestern Indonesia, so zooming in on this section of the country gives map readers the opportunity to understand choropleth information in these provinces as well. Internal migration flow data is compared with GDP per capita data for each province, which is shown on the choropleth map and listed on the legend in US Dollars. Given that this map will be primarily viewed by US citizens, I chose to list GDP per capita in US Dollars rather than Rupiah, the currency of Indonesia. The choropleth map is shown in shades of green because viewers may associate green with money and the color of US Dollars. The results of this map show that a vast majority of migration in Indonesia takes place in the southwestern portion of the country. This makes sense because this area of the country is the most population and flows to and from this area overwhelm all other flows in Indonesia and appear in the top 100. It also shows that while GDP per capita might be correlated with increased in-migration in provinces like Jakarta and Riau (dark green province in northwestern Indonesia), this is not the case for all provinces. For example, the only other province with a comparable GDP per capita to Jakarta is Kalimantan Timur (dark green province in central Indonesia) and the migration flows to and from this province are not great enough to be shown in the top 100 flows.
